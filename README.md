The hair salon website was created using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, 
as well as HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the website. JavaScript was used to add interactivity and 
functionality to the website, such as allowing users to purchase salon services, connect with the salon owner via email,
and view the salon location on a map.

By leveraging these technologies, the hair salon website provides a seamless user experience that is both easy to navigate 
and visually appealing. Customers can easily browse the salon's services and pricing, make appointments, and even contact 
the salon owner directly through email. The use of location mapping also makes it easy for customers to find the salon and 
plan their visit accordingly.

Overall, the hair salon website showcases the power of modern web technologies in creating a compelling and user-friendly
online presence for businesses of all types.
